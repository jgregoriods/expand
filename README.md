<h2>Simulation of demic expansions in tropical South America</h2>
<p>This is an agent-based model for simulating the demic expansion of tropical forest farmers in late Holocene South America. Over the last 5000 years, archaeological cultures like the Saladoid-Barrancoid and Tupiguarani expanded over different parts of Amazon and beyond, spreading the practice of polyculture agroforestry. Can these archaeological expansions be modelled as demic waves of advance? Model results are assessed by comparing simulated arrival times with radiocarbon dates. Similar models have been developed for the spread of farming in Europe (Fort et al. 2012). A similar concept is adopted here, with the rules of the model informed by the ethnography of tropical forest farmers. For a complete description of the model, see Souza et al. (2020).</p>
